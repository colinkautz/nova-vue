# Vue for Nova editor

This is a plugin providing Vue language support for the new [Nova editor from Panic](https://panic.com/nova/). Inspired by [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) and many other great Vue tools.

## Modes üî•

The extension now support two different mode: **Classic** and **Vetur**! You can set it in the global extension preferences and also on a project based.

In the future I'll look into a way of combining the best of both worlds, in the meantime which one should you use? Of course is up to you üòâ

### Vetur (default)

A complete Vetur like mode with all the great features you are already used to.

### Classic

Ad hoc completions for Nova and great snippets for faster development.

## Special theming üé®

The extension offers an easy way to improve the highlighting in Vue file.

### Hooks

This is an example of implementation with all the available hooks:

```css
